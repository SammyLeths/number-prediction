# Simple Number Prediction

A very basic number guessing game.

The game randomly selects a number between 1 and 20 that you have to guess.

Every wrong guess deducts 1 point from your score.

Your score at the time of guessing the right number becomes your highscore.

After a successful guess, you can start the game all over with the 'Try again' button in a bid to beat your previous highscore.
